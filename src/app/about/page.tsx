              Hello! I am a junior full-stack developer from the Philippines. I have a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              My journey in technology has equipped me with a diverse set of skills, allowing me to work on various aspects of web development, from front-end design to back-end functionality.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              In addition to my development skills, I also produce music and have experience in video editing. I enjoy combining my technical expertise with my creative pursuits, striving to deliver engaging experiences that resonate with users. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Whether Iâ€™m coding a new feature, producing a track, or editing a video, I always aim for excellence in everything I do.
              I'm excited to continue growing and exploring new technologies and creative outlets, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
